          <p><img src="Icon.png" alt=""> Whether you are a parent caring for your own child or a pediatrician, this growth charts app is for you! Developed as part of a research project at <a href="http://childrenshospital.org">Boston Children's Hospital</a>, you can track your childrens' growth over time and display the data points on any of the included WHO and CDC charts. There is also a percentile calculator for quick lookup  of weight, length, head circumference and BMI percentiles in case you just want to know the percentile of today's measurement. ðŸ‘¶</p>

<h2>Included Charts</h2>

<p>The app currently includes the official growth charts from these institutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int">World Health Organization</a></p>

<ul>
<li>0 - 24 months (weight, height and head circumference)</li>
<li>2 - 5 years (weight and height)</li>
<li>5 - 10 years (weight)</li>
<li>5 - 19 years (height and BMI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (US)</p>

<ul>
<li>0 - 36 months (weight, height and head circumference)</li>
<li>2 - 20 years (weight, height and BMI)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>You can add as many children and measurements to the built-in database as you like. The data is encrypted -- if you have a passcode on your device -- meaning it is secure should you lose the device. This is your data, it doesn't leave the app.</p>

<h1>Feedback &amp; Support</h1>
