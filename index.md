Included Charts
---------------

The app currently includes the official growth charts from these institutions:

* [World Health Organization][who]
  * 0 - 24 months (weight, height and head circumference)
  * 2 - 5 years (weight and height)
  * 5 - 10 years (weight)
  * 5 - 19 years (height and BMI)

* [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention][cdc] (US)
  * 0 - 36 months (weight, height and head circumference)
  * 2 - 20 years (weight, height and BMI)

Data Storage
------------

You can add as many children and measurements to the built-in database as you like. The data is encrypted -- if you have a passcode on your device -- meaning it is secure should you lose the device. This is your data, it doesn't leave the app.
