<section id="main_content"><p><img class="icon" src="icon.png" alt="" /> Whether you are a parent caring for your own child or a pediatrician, this growth charts app is for you!</p>

<p>Developed as part of a research project at <a href="http://childrenshospital.org">Boston Children&#39;s Hospital</a>, you can track your childrens&#39; growth over time and display the data points on any of the included WHO and CDC charts. You can track <strong>height</strong>, <strong>weight</strong>, <strong>head circumference</strong> and <strong>BMI</strong>. The latter is automatically calculated from height and weight.</p>

<p>There is also a <strong>percentile calculator</strong> for quick percentile lookup in case you just want to know the percentile of today&#39;s measurements.</p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>

<p>The measurements are directly added to the growth chart PDFs. You can email these PDFs or print them out (if you have an AirPrint enabled printer nearby).</p>

<h2>Included Charts</h2>

<p>The app currently includes the official growth charts from these institutions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>World Health Organization (<a href="http://www.who.int">WHO</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>0 - 24 months (weight, height and head circumference)</li>
<li>2 - 5 years (weight and height)</li>
<li>5 - 10 years (weight)</li>
<li>5 - 19 years (height and BMI)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov">CDC</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>0 - 36 months (weight, height and head circumference)</li>
<li>2 - 20 years (weight, height and BMI)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>You can add as many children and measurements to the built-in database as you like. The data is encrypted -- if you have a passcode on your device -- meaning it is secure should you lose the device. This is your data, it doesn&#39;t leave the app.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>To run this app you will need a device running <strong>iOS version 6.0</strong> or newer.</p>
