<img class="icon" src="icon.png" srcset="icon@2x.png 2x" alt="" /> Whether you are a **parent** caring for your own child or a **pediatrician**, this growth charts app is for you!
It allows you to track childrens' growth over time and display the data points on any of the included WHO and CDC growth charts.
You can track _height_, _weight_, _head circumference_ and _BMI_ and determine the corresponding percentiles.

There is also a **percentile calculator** for quick percentile lookup in case you just want to know the percentile of today's measurements.

Data Storage
------------

You can add as many children and measurements to the built-in database as you like.
The data is encrypted â€“ if you have a passcode on your device â€“ meaning it is secure should you lose the device.
Please also see our [privacy policy](../privacy-policy).


Sharing
-------

The measurements are directly added to the growth chart PDFs.
You can email these PDFs, print them out (if you have an AirPrint enabled printer nearby) or share them with other means provided by iOS, such as storing into your Dropbox or box.com.


Included Charts
---------------

The app currently includes 32 official growth charts from these institutions:

* **World Health Organization** ([WHO])
  * 0 - 24 months (weight, length, head circumference and weight for length)
  * 2 - 5 years (weight, height and weight for height)
  * 5 - 10 years (weight)
  * 5 - 19 years (height and BMI)

* **Centers for Disease Control and Prevention** ([CDC])
  * 0 - 36 months (weight, height, head circumference and weight for length)
  * 2 - 20 years (weight, height, BMI and weight for height)


Units
-----

Whether you're used to the **metric system** and have all data available in centimeter and kilogram or whether you're in the US and using **imperial units**, Charts has got you covered.
You can switch the units you want to use for input right from the keyboard:

<div class="screenshots">
	<img src="units.png" srcset="units@2x.png 2x" alt="Unit Switching" />
</div>

These units will be saved as your preferred units.
You can also change those units from a dedicated list when viewing your child's measurements.

------------

To run this app you will need a device running **iOS version 7.0** or newer. ðŸ‘¶
