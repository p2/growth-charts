Developed as part of a research project at [Boston Children's Hospital][bch], you can track your childrens' growth over time and display the data points on any of the included WHO and CDC charts. There is also a percentile calculator for quick lookup  of weight, length, head circumference and BMI percentiles in case you just want to know the percentile of today's measurement. ðŸ‘¶\r\n\r\nIncluded Charts\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe app currently includes the official growth charts from these institutions:\r\n\r\n* [World Health Organization][who]\r\n  * 0 - 24 months (weight, height and head circumference)\r\n  * 2 - 5 years (weight and height)\r\n  * 5 - 10 years (weight)\r\n  * 5 - 19 years (height and BMI)\r\n\r\n* [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention][cdc] (US)\r\n  * 0 - 36 months (weight, height and head circumference)\r\n  * 2 - 20 years (weight, height and BMI)\r\n\r\nData Storage\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou can add as many children and measurements to the built-in database as you like. The data is encrypted -- if you have a passcode on your device -- meaning it is secure should you lose the device. This is your data, it doesn't leave the app.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFeedback & Support\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIf you are having problems with the app or have suggestions, head over [to the issue page][issues] and let us know!\r\n\r\n\r\n[bch]: http://childrenshospital.org\r\n[who]: http://www.who.int\r\n[cdc]: http://www.cdc.gov\r\n[chip]: http://www.chip.org\r\n[snf]: http://www.snf.ch\r\n[issues]: https://github.com/p2/growth-charts/issues","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
